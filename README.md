## The lead of new technologies in forensic science 
### **Facial recognition**
            What is facial recognition? 
            How does it assist forensic scientists? 
            The cold case of Madeleine McCann:
Child exploitation image analytics → facial recognition 
Training facial recognition algorithms on large datasets of image of child exploitation from the dark web
Working this algorithm into the existent media-forensics tools that are currently in use

### **Nanotechnology**
Nanoparticles based imaging → improve imaging techniques in forensics, enabling better visualisation of complex biological structures. 
Nanoparticle-based drug delivery
### ***Automation***
