## The lead of new technologies in forensic science 
### **Facial recognition**
            What is facial recognition? 
            How does it assist forensic scientists? 
            The cold case of Madeleine McCann:

Facial recognition has emerged as a powerful tool in various domains, and its application in forensic science has become increasingly significant. Forensic science, the application of scientific methods to investigate and solve crimes, has seen a transformative impact with the integration of facial recognition technology. Facial recognition is a method of identifying and confirming one's individual identity using one’s face. Facial recognition systems are often used to identify people in photos, videos or in real time. It is a category of biometric security, which is often used for security and law enforcement. 

The most common and familiar face recognition technology is through FaceID used to unlock iphones. However the difference here is that it simply identifies and recognises one person as the sole owner of the device, while limiting access to others. Another notable application of facial recognition in forensic science is the rapid identification of individuals from surveillance footage or crime scene images. Law enforcement agencies worldwide have adopted facial recognition systems to match faces captured in these images with existing databases of known individuals. This capability expedites the process of suspect identification, enabling investigators to swiftly narrow down potential leads and accelerate criminal investigations.
